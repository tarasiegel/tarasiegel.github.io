# Full Stack Kitchen

This is the repo for [http://www.fullstackkitchen.com/](http://www.fullstackkitchen.com/). 

The website is written in React + [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and the blog posts in Markdown + JS.

The `master-react` branch houses all of the react code.
When I deploy the gatsby app, it compiles it to plain HTML (for SEO purposes) and [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) pushes it to the `master` branch.

This set up was used so I could utilize Github Pages as a way to host my food blog. 

If you have any questions about this, please message/follow me on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/taras.kitchen/).
