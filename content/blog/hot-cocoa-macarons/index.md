The first month of the New Year has already flown by and itâ€™s bitter cold here in Brooklyn.  Even though winter is always fun (ie. skiing), I get that yearning to be on a beach in Mexico or basking in the Mediterranean sun whenever I am trudging to work through the snowy dirty streets of New York.  Making and eating this Mexican Ricotta Cheesecake with a Tomato Mole Jam is possibly the next best thing to hopping on a flight to warmer weather.  It has loads of spicy, complex flavors that will keep you warm and preoccupied until the sun comes out in a few months.
