**hi, Welcome to my little corner of the internet.  i'm tara.**

I have been living in New York City for the past four years, currently residing in Williamsburg.  Before that, I spent the first 18 years of my life in South Florida living that humid life. Once I left for school in Philadelphia, I realized I loved baking for my friends and running it off. 

I studied Computer Science in school (+ a fine arts minor - all about that #balance) and am currently a full time Software Engineer for a media company.
