I say -ish because that sugar glaze is definitely not helping my case, but the jam inside, there’s zucchini in it! Thats healthy! And chia seeds! I had strawberries and zucchini in my fridge and thought can I jam it? Yes I can apparently. And its super good. I have been eating the left over jam for days on crackers and in my yogurt.  Jam ratios usually are 2:1 fruit to sugar.  The chia seeds expand to give it a jammy texture, that allows for very little sugar to be added to the jam and it to keep that consistency. Let me know if you try the jam or pop tart!
