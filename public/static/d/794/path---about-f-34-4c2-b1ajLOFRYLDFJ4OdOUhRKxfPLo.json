Before that, I spent the first eighteen years of my life in South Florida dealing with that humid hair life.  Then I spent four in Philadelphia for college, where I discovered and honed my love of baking while procrasinating problem sets.  Many times I would be making muffins at midnight to break up the <em>all too frequent</em> all-nighters I pulled.</p>\n<p>I studied Computer Science/Computer Graphics in school (+ a fine arts minor) and am currently a full time, full stack Software Engineer for a media company. Having an office to bring sweets to is key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. To counteract what doesn’t make it into the office, I am constantly trying to find ways to be exercising.  I am an advid runner, biker (I try to CitiBike to work every day if its over 35˚), and walker (and will walk places to avoid the subway at all costs).  Right now I’ve completed 5 half marathons and 1 century ride!</p>\n<p>If we can get nerdy for a second, I am very proud of this website you see here. The “tech stack”, as one would say, is pretty cool.  I am using React, which is build by Facebook and is a component based Javascript library for building UI’s. That is wrapped in an instance of GatsbyJs, which is a React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator (makes for better SEO and file hosting!).  All the posts are written in markdown, which is a lightweight markup language for text syntax.  Once I make updates and build it, it hooks into GitHub Pages and automatically updates the site! </p>","fields":{"slug":"/about/"},"frontmatter":{"date":null,"title":"About","image":{"childImageSharp":{"resize":{"src":"/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/f2c68/about-image.jpg"},"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":0.9907407407407407,"src":"/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/30c9d/about-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/50610/about-image.jpg 197w,\n/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/241fe/about-image.jpg 393w,\n/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/30c9d/about-image.jpg 786w,\n/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/d9daf/about-image.jpg 1179w,\n/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/349c3/about-image.jpg 1572w,\n/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/4266f/about-image.jpg 2358w,\n/static/9f73aac289633d828e444db0a15f842b/c2150/about-image.jpg 2996w","sizes":"(max-width: 786px) 100vw, 786px"}}}}}}]}},"pageContext":{}}
