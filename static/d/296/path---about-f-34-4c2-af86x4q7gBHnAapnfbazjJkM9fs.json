Before that, I spent the first eighteen years of my life in South Florida dealing with that humid hair life.  Then I spent four in Philadelphia for college, where I discovered and honed my love of baking while procrasinating problem sets.  Many times I would be making muffins at midnight to break up the <em>all too frequent</em> all-nighters I pulled.</p>\n<p>I studied Computer Science/Computer Graphics in school (+ a fine arts minor) and am currently a full time, full stack Software Engineer for a media company. Having an office to bring sweets to is key and prevents me from eating all of it. To counteract what doesn’t make it into the office, I am constantly trying to find ways to be exercising.  I am an advid runner, biker (I try to CitiBike to work every day if its over 35˚), and walker (and will walk places to avoid the subway at all costs).  Right now I’ve completed 5 half marathons and 1 century ride.</p>\n<p>If we can get nerdy for a second, I am very proud of this website you see here. The “tech stack”, as one would say, is pretty cool.  I am using React, which is build by Facebook and is a component based Javascript library for building UI’s. That is wrapped in an instance of GatsbyJs, which is a React-based, GraphQL powered, static site generator (makes for better SEO and file hosting!).  All the posts are written in markdown, which is a lightweight markup language for text syntax.  Once I make updates and build it, it hooks into GitHub Pages and automatically updates the site! </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About","date":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blood-orange-bars/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Blood Orange Bars"}},"next":null}}
